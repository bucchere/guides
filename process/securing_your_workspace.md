# Securing Your Workspace

With a few simple tricks you can secure your machine.

* Enable FileVault. Your hard drive needs to be encrypted to protect the data should the machine be stolen.
* Require a password to login. Fresh reboots should not automatically log you in.
* Enable Auto-lock/sleep after 10 minutes.
* Never leave your laptop unlocked. Don't walk away for lunch or an errand without locking your computer.
* Keep your laptop in a safe place. e.g. Not in your car's front seat. Cars are broken into very often. If you must leave it in your car, put it in the trunk or hide it well.
* Use a password manager, like 1Password to keep your passwords hard/secure between sites. 

And finally, if your workspace is compromised physically or digitally, please notify Chris, Matt and Dean as well as your team lead immediately.

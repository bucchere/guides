# Securing Your Workspace

With a few simple tricks you can secure your machine.

* Enable FileVault. Your hard drive needs to be encrypted to protect the data should the machine be stolen.
* Require a password to login. Fresh reboots should not automatically log you in.
* Enable Auto-lock/sleep after 10 minutes.
* Never leave your laptop unlocked. Don't walk away for lunch or an errand without locking your computer.
* Keep your laptop in a safe place. e.g. Not in your car. Cars are broken into very often.

And finally, if your workspace is compromised physically or digitally, please notify Chris, Matt and/or Dean immediately.
